## Description

_b r 3_ is a remake of my game [_v r 3_](https://www.pippinbarr.com/2017/03/29/v-r-3/), translating it from [Unity](https://unity.com/) to [Bitsy](https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy). Given that Unity is a big ol' serious 3D game engine with lighting and all that, and Bitsy is a tiny game engine that provides only a 16x16 grid of 8x8 tiles, it's quite a translation process. In _b r 3_ as in _v r 3_ you enter a building which serves as a gallery of water. Inside, a series of plinths present different waters from existing Bitsy games and the visitor can both examine the water more closely as well as open the originating game itself. The objective, as with _v r 3_ is to centralize an element of (Bitsy) games that might otherwise tend to be overlooked in favour of narrative and spatial exploration. In _b r 3_ especially, however, the creative work of other game designers is foregrounded, as the water comes directly from other creations, rather than being a kind of commodity from an asset store as with _v r 3_.

## History

I started _b r 3_ mostly because I have needed to work on simple projects during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given I made _b r 1_ (a translation of _v r 1_) first, I started out planning to make, well, _b r 2_ (translating _v r 2_), but I ran into various conceptual difficulties with that game and so decided to skip ahead to a more "straightforward" translation into Bitsy.

The key realization in the game was really that the right kind of water to display would be from existing Bitsy games rather than attempting to create a series of waters myself. This remains true to the spirit of exhibiting the creative work of others rather than my own, and, if you ask me, is even better in that it highlights actual games from a community rather than water as a kind of technical commodity as in _v r 3_ (interesting though that is). As such, a huge part of the effort in making _b r 3_ was just obtaining and including those waters into this game. It ended up requiring writing a generator in JavaScript that could generate the data for the game, to avoid me having to hand paint and position every single tile in the game (there are many!).

Even early on, once I had a couple of waters in position, it was pretty clear to me this is a project I was going to be happy with. I think that as _v r 3_ shows, and as _b r 3_ affirms, encountering some specific element of games in isolation, with the chance to appreciate just that one piece of craft, is a genuinely valuable experience.

## Technology

_b r 3_ was made in Adam Le Doux's excellent [Bitsy](https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy) game engine. It includes a script written in JavaScript that generates the gallery itself.
