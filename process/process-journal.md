# b r 2? b r 3! (Friday, 27 March 2020, 10:50AM)

## b r 2?

I spent some time thinking about the more obvious decision to make b r 2, because it's, you know, next. But I find it really tricky trying to understand how I'd go about. I've written about it before somewhere I think, but the concept of hiding one thing in another thing doesn't make tons of sense in Bitsy. Although that said, there is one obvious idea which is to put all the things in, and then simple paint over them in the editor. Then there's the question of what the things would actually be. Anyway, that's for another time.

## b r 3!

So instead I'm doing b r 3, because it's a bit clearer to me. I go out into the world of existing Bitsy games, find those that portray water in their little 8x8 tiles, and important the water into my own Bitsy game, which shows off the water along with attribution to the original creator.

In the current prototype I've mostly been trying to explore the hypothetical display of multiple waters. Given it's a demake I'd like to maintain the same 3x8 format of the building, but may only have one space given that it's all 3rd party water and there's no default water available, nor enough parameters to be able to show a whole lot of variations on a "single" water. Unless the joke is the lack of parameters.

In putting in the first water so I had something to work with (from [Everything Must Fall](https://halkon.itch.io/everything-must-fall) by [Halkon](https://halkon.itch.io/)) it became apparent you need more than one tile's worth of the water to actually understand it. Water is a continuous thing and it seems like when people draw it in a tile they do end up relying on the idea of repetition aesthetically (understandably).  So for instance this first water takes account of the idea of being tiled to create a more continuous animation. For now I'm displaying any given water in a 3x3 grid of tiles, and will also need some kind of didact to attribute. Right now I've got a little plinth thing that's inset into the grid of water which looks kind of nice somehow. It works.

Remaining questions revolve around the building structure itself, which I'd like to reference the original game. I'd like to start outside it and have the player walk in ideally, and thus to have a surrounding landscape. I'd like to create the sense of being inside when you're in it, too, but I'm not sure how plausible that is in terms of having walls/windows etc. I'd love to somehow project light from the windows over the floor, but that will almost certainly conflict really badly with the water itself.

Probably the immediate solution is to import a couple more waters for variety, then set up the building stuff, then get the result of the waters. By the standards of the original game I need 3x8 which is 24 which is... a ton. When I looked through Lorenzo Pilia's list of games as a place to start I only found two easily (just by looking at their icon). But we'll see. There's a ton of Bitsy games out there.

Onward and upward with the arts.
